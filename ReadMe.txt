# GitHub Enterprise Test Repository – Chico State

Welcome to the CSU Chico GitHub Enterprise test environment—a proving ground for the version-control muscle we’re building across campus. This space demonstrates how we plan to run code with discipline, transparency, and just enough swagger to keep things interesting.

## Purpose

This repository highlights our push toward:

- **Enterprise-Grade DevOps** – Institution-wide adoption of modern development discipline  
- **Secure Collaboration** – Teamwork fortified with serious security controls  
- **Scalable Infrastructure** – A platform designed to grow, not groan, as demands increase  

## Key Features

- ✓ Advanced branch-protection rules  
- ✓ Integrated CI/CD pipelines  
- ✓ Full audit logging and compliance tracking  
- ✓ Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- ✓ Enterprise single sign-on (SSO)  

## Status

This implementation reflects a modern, forward-leaning approach to academic infrastructure—engineered and maintained by the CSU Chico technology team, with an eye toward reliability, security, and scale.
